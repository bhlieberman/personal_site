There are many like it, but this one is mine.</h3><section>I am a writer, reader, and full-stack web developer from Baltimore, MD, USA. Currently, I live in Albuquerque, in the Land of Enchantment, New Mexico. I take pride in being entirely self-taught in the myriad disciplines and skills required to be a professional programmer. My educational background is in international affairs. I earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in 2018. I am the author of a novel, Filthy Synecdoche, which appeared through Corona/Samizdat Press in 2022.</section></div></body></html>
