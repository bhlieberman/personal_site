# Rushes

This page will be a kind of free-form blog containing whatever I want. The name is inspired by the term from cinema for unedited cuts of film, sometimes called "dailies." Sometimes, the media on this page may actually be film (probably digital) footage; or it may simply be text, notes, poems, or content cribbed from the ether.
